# Data Directory

This directory contains the sample datasets for the metabarcoding course.

## Structure

- `raw_sequences/`: Contains raw paired-end FASTQ files from 16S rRNA gene sequencing
  - Files follow the naming convention: `sample[N]_R[1/2].fastq`
  - R1: forward reads
  - R2: reverse reads

## Sample Information

The dataset includes two bacterial community samples:
- **sample1**: Environmental sample 1
- **sample2**: Environmental sample 2

These are small demonstration datasets containing bacterial 16S rRNA V4 region sequences for educational purposes.
